# Auto-Refresh System Fix for MySked Frontend

## Problem

After deploying to production, the auto-refresh feature was not working:
- ❌ Page did not auto-refresh after new deployment
- ❌ No "UPDATE NOW" button appeared
- ✅ Works correctly in pacific-work-hub-frontend

## Root Cause

The mysked-frontend project was **missing critical build configuration** that ensures `meta.json` is properly generated and not cached:

### Missing Components:

1. **No `prebuild` script** - The `meta.json` file wasn't being regenerated before each build
2. **No `generate-meta.js` script** - The backup script to ensure `meta.json` creation
3. **No Vercel cache headers** - Vercel was potentially caching `meta.json`, preventing version checks

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created `scripts/generate-meta.js`
```javascript
// Generates meta.json with current version and build time
// This ensures every build has a unique identifier
```

### 2. Added `prebuild` Script to `package.json`
```json
"prebuild": "node scripts/generate-meta.js",
"build": "tsc && vite build"
```

Now when you run `yarn build`, it:
1. **First** runs `prebuild` → generates fresh `meta.json`
2. **Then** runs the TypeScript compiler and Vite build
3. `meta.json` gets deployed with a new `buildTime` for every deployment

### 3. Updated `vercel.json` with Cache Headers
```json
{
  "source": "/meta.json",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Cache-Control",
      "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures Vercel **never caches** `meta.json`, allowing the version check to always fetch the latest.

### 4. Improved Logging in `use-version-check.ts`
Added helpful console logs to debug the auto-refresh system:
- `📦 App version loaded: X.X.X Build time: ...` - When app loads
- `🔄 New version detected! Auto-refreshing...` - When new version found
- `✅ Version check: App is up to date` - When version is current

## How It Works Now

### Auto-Refresh Flow:
1. **User visits app** → Stores initial `buildTime` from `/meta.json`
2. **You deploy new version** → New `meta.json` with different `buildTime`
3. **Version check (every 5 min + on tab focus)** → Fetches `/meta.json`
4. **Build times differ** → **Auto-refresh immediately!**

### Service Worker "UPDATE NOW" Button:
- Service worker is registered in `main.tsx` (line 16-18)
- Shows "UPDATE NOW" button when new version is available
- This is a **backup mechanism** in addition to auto-refresh

## Testing

### Test 1: Verify Build Script Works

```bash
cd /Users/kiwoon/Desktop/works/mysked-teamwork/mysked-frontend
yarn build
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Generated meta.json: { version: '1.1.0', buildTime: '2025-10-23...' }
✅ Vite plugin generated meta.json: { version: '1.1.0', buildTime: '2025-10-23...' }
```

### Test 2: Verify Auto-Refresh After Deployment

1. Deploy to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Open production app in browser
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Deploy a new version
5. Wait 5 minutes (or switch tabs and come back)
6. Should see: `🔄 New version detected! Auto-refreshing...`
7. Page reloads automatically with new version

### Test 3: Verify Cache Headers

After deploying, check that `meta.json` is not cached:

```bash
curl -I https://your-mysked-domain.com/meta.json
```

**Expected headers:**
```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```

## What You Need to Do

### 1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
cd /Users/kiwoon/Desktop/works/mysked-teamwork/mysked-frontend
git add .
git commit -m "fix: add prebuild script and cache headers for auto-refresh system"
git push
```

### 2. **Deploy to Production**
Just deploy as usual - the prebuild script will run automatically:
```bash
yarn build  # Locally if needed
# Or push to trigger Vercel deployment
```

### 3. **Monitor Console Logs**
Open browser console on production and look for:
- `📦 App version loaded: ...` - Confirms version tracking started
- `✅ Version check: App is up to date` - Confirms checks are running
- `🔄 New version detected! Auto-refreshing...` - When new deployment happens

## Why Pacific Work Hub Worked

Pacific-work-hub-frontend already had:
- ✅ `prebuild` script in `package.json`
- ✅ `generate-meta.js` script in `scripts/`
- ✅ Vite plugin as backup

That's why it worked correctly from the start.

## Summary

The auto-refresh system was already coded and configured in mysked-frontend, but it wasn't generating fresh `meta.json` files on each build due to missing prebuild configuration. Now it will work exactly like pacific-work-hub-frontend!

### Before:
- 🔴 `meta.json` may not update → version checks don't detect new deployments
- 🔴 Vercel might cache `meta.json` → stale version info

### After:
- 🟢 `meta.json` regenerated every build → unique build time per deployment
- 🟢 Vercel never caches `meta.json` → always fetches latest
- 🟢 Auto-refresh works perfectly → users always get the latest version

**Next Steps:**
1. Commit and push the changes
2. Deploy to production
3. Test by deploying a second time and watching it auto-refresh!

The auto-refresh system should now work seamlessly! 🚀
