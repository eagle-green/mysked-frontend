# How to Force Google to Update Your Search Listing

## Current Problem
When searching "mysked" on Google, you see:
- **Old Title**: "Jwt - MySked: Sign in"
- **Old Description**: "Sign in to your account. Please log in with the account provided by admin team..."

## New (Correct) Information
After deployment, Google will see:
- **New Title**: "MySked - Workforce Management & Scheduling Platform"
- **New Description**: "Professional workforce management software for scheduling, timesheets, job tracking, and field operations. Built for traffic control companies and service businesses."

## Quick Steps to Force Update

### Step 1: Deploy Your Changes
```bash
cd /Users/kiwoon/Desktop/works/mysked-teamwork/mysked-frontend
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Update SEO meta tags and improve Google Search listing"
git push
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to deploy.

### Step 2: Open Google Search Console
1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select property: **mysked.ca**

### Step 3: Request Re-Indexing (MOST IMPORTANT!)
1. In left sidebar, click: **URL Inspection**
2. Enter: `https://mysked.ca/`
3. Wait for inspection to complete (10-30 seconds)
4. Click the blue button: **Request Indexing**
5. Confirm the request

### Step 4: Clear Google's Cache (Optional but Helpful)
1. Go to: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals
2. Click "Temporarily remove URL"
3. Enter: `https://mysked.ca/`
4. Select "Remove this URL only"
5. Click "Submit Request"
6. Wait 12-24 hours, then request re-indexing again

## Verification

### Check if Google Has Updated:
1. Search "mysked" on Google
2. Look for new title: "MySked - Workforce Management & Scheduling Platform"
3. If still showing old title, wait 24 more hours and check again

### Alternative Verification:
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Navigate to: **Performance** > **Search Results**
3. Check "Impressions" and "Clicks" data
4. Look for increase after re-indexing

## Why This Happens

**Root Cause:**
- Google crawled your site weeks/months ago
- Cached the login page content (because it's the homepage)
- Shows that cached version in search results

**Why It Takes Time:**
- Google has billions of pages to crawl
- Your site might be crawled only once per week
- Cache updates can take 7-14 days
- "Request Indexing" prioritizes your site but doesn't guarantee instant update

## Alternative: Use Google's Rich Results Test

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Enter: `https://mysked.ca/`
3. Click "Test URL"
4. Verify that it shows:
   - Title: "MySked - Workforce Management & Scheduling Platform"
   - Description: (new improved description)

This confirms Google CAN see the new content; it just hasn't updated search results yet.

## If It's Still Not Updated After 2 Weeks

1. Check that deployment was successful:
   - Visit: https://mysked.ca/
   - View page source (right-click > View Page Source)
   - Search for `<title>MySked - Workforce Management`
   - Verify meta description is correct

2. Re-submit indexing request in Search Console

3. Check for errors in Search Console:
   - Navigate to: **Coverage** report
   - Look for any errors or warnings

4. Contact Google Search Console support (if still having issues)

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Update `sitemap.xml` when adding pages**
   - Update `<lastmod>` dates
   - Submit to Google Search Console

2. **Monitor Search Console weekly**
   - Check for indexing errors
   - Review "Coverage" report

3. **Request re-indexing after major changes**
   - New features
   - Homepage redesigns
   - Meta tag updates

4. **Keep content fresh**
   - Update public pages regularly
   - Add blog/news section (future consideration)
   - Google prefers sites with fresh content
